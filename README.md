# This has been created for the 3 part interview Technical Test
# Please find parts 1, 2 and 3 here
# 
# Vagrant file is here for each part
# Cd to each directory and run vagrant up should suffice
# The Docker and Ansible with Vagrant is quite new to me really enjoyed these tasks.
# I have been working on Puppet for a long time with KVM and VMWare so change has been nice,
# it is like riding a bike :)
# I think there is a lot of room for improvement with the coding especially with the VM creation in rabbitmq, 
# that could be done on the fly instead of using docker-compose file,
# but sadly I didn't want to run out of time and not have something finished for you.
#
# I used
# vagrant 2.2.6
# ansible 2.9.6
